        <p>3Sided Projects was born when Vin, Scriv and Jenna met in Philadelphia while pursuing their MFAs in exhibition design. After graduation, Jenna moved to Sacramento, but the three friends decided that distance would not keep them from collaborating, rather they would use their bi-coastal reach to benefit their clients and creative endeavors.</p>

                <p>Jenna is a designer, specializing in digital collaboration and prototyping for the development of

progressive design projects. She received her BA in Art History from the University of California Santa 

Barbara, later completing her graduate work in Exhibition Planning and Design at the University of the 

Arts in Philadelphia. Now back in her home state of California, Jenna is driven by a deep belief in human-centered design decisions and iterations. By focusing on project communication she is able to guide a 

variety of design projects from their incubation stage into final build.</p>

                <p>Vinson is an artist, designer, illustrator, and exhibition planner from Philadelphia, PA. He received a BFA

in Painting & Drawing and MFA in Museum Exhibition Planning & Design, both from the University of the 

Arts in Philadelphia. He takes anyone with a sense of humor very seriously. He believes playfulness is a 

pillar of design which makes him a very curious individual who takes pleasure in seeking undiscovered 

possibilities. Heâ€™s self-disciplined and very much open to new opportunities which utilize his skills, both 

seasoned and newly learned, to expand the knowledge of all things interesting.</p>
